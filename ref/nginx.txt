homebrew install nginx

The default directory is /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.0.6/. We'll change that
by starting nginx with the -c (config) directive. In ~/Library/LaunchAgents/,
create a file named org.nginx.nginx.plist, with the contents:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>org.nginx.nginx</string>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>UserName</key>
    <string>ckoenig</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>sudo</string>
        <string>/usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.0.8/sbin/nginx</string>
        <string>-g</string>
        <string>daemon off;</string>
        <string>-c</string>
        <string>/Users/ckoenig/.jenkins/jobs/languishes/workspace/conf/nginx.conf</string>
    </array>
    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/ckoenig/.jenkins/jobs/languishes/workspace</string>
  </dict>
</plist>

Since this doesn't start nginx with "sudo nginx", it's not allowed to bind to
port 80. There's no easy way to circumvent this on OS X, so what I ended up
doing was forwarding my port 80 to 8080, using the following ipfw rule:
  sudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from any to any 80 in
